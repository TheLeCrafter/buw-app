# Contributing to the App

## Requirements
You need to install the latest version of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and fork the repository into a personal fork. I also recommend you to use Android Studio or Visual Studio Code to modify files.

## Start contributing
You can find the project files in the ``lib`` directory. The lib directory is split up into two sections. The first section is the direct lib directory that contains the not visual code and the second section is the ``screens`` directory that contains all visual code. The homescreen.dart is the file that handles the home screen and the detailed home screen scaffold widgets.

## Pull Requests
If you think your code is ready to merge create a pull request from your edited branch to the master branch and follow the guidelines. The pull request will be reviewed and merged if there are no errors.
